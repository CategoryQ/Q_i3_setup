Q_i3_setup
==========
Category's xmonad-ish i3 config

Played with several tiling window managers, and really liked the shortcuts of xmond, but hated having to configure it with Haskell. I had never used haskell before, and likely never shall again.

i3 is excellent, so reconfigured the shortcuts to be closer to xmonad defaults.

Made public for my [blog post on the subject](https://quintendo.wordpress.com/2018/05/19/i3-tiling-window-manager-xmonad-style-keybindings/)
